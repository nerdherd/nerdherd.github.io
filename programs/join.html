            <h1>On-Season (January – April): </h1>

            <p>The season kicks off on the 2nd weekend of January, where a new game and manual is released. The team must design, machine, assemble, program the robot until it’s ready to clash on the field. For each season, the contribution of every individual is reflected deeply in their own unique way. But we not only make robots but also create documentation and submit award applications to ensure that we are fully ready for competition! </p>
            <p>Every week meetings are held three times with a duration of three hours, generally on Monday, Friday, and Saturday ensuring that enough time is given for each sub team to do their tasks.</p>

            <h1>Off-Season (May-December): </h1>

            <p>Offseason is a great opportunity to upscale your skill set, and those with leadership roles are doing their best to give training to members. No matter the experience one has, everyone has a role in making the robot into something we can be very proud of.</p>
